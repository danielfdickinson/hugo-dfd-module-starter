# DFD Hugo Module Starter

A starter repo for building Hugo modules (by Daniel F. Dickinson)

## Features

* Hugo module
* exampleSite (for demo deploys and/or documentation)
* Netlify-ready
  * Cache resources folder (exampleSite)
  * HTML Validation
  * Check internal links
  * HTML Minification

## Not a Theme

**Note:** This is not a theme, or even a theme component (although it could the basis for one).
This is a Hugo module skeleton, but with useful defaults for many of the files you will need in a
useful module.
